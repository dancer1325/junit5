[[overview-getting-started-example-projects]]
==== Example Projects

To see complete, working examples of projects that you can copy and experiment with, the
{junit5-samples-repo}[`junit5-samples`] repository is a good place to start. The
`junit5-samples` repository hosts a collection of sample projects based on JUnit Jupiter,
JUnit Vintage, and other testing frameworks. You'll find appropriate build scripts (e.g.,
`build.gradle`, `pom.xml`, etc.) in the example projects. The links below highlight some
of the combinations you can choose from.

* For Gradle and Java, check out the `{junit5-jupiter-starter-gradle}` project.
* For Gradle and Kotlin, check out the `{junit5-jupiter-starter-gradle-kotlin}` project.
* For Gradle and Groovy, check out the `{junit5-jupiter-starter-gradle-groovy}` project.
* For Maven, check out the `{junit5-jupiter-starter-maven}` project.
* For Ant, check out the `{junit5-jupiter-starter-ant}` project.
